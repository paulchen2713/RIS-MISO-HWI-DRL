## Paper
Rejected by IEEE VTC2024-Spring\
Working paper on ~IEEE Wireless Communication Letters~  IEEE Globecom 2024

## Note
~I'll upload the code once I graduate or the paper gets accepted~ Never mind.\
The code is a mess. I'm burning out. I give up.

## Installing
- Install Anaconda
- Import the environment
  ```
  conda env create --file sb3.yaml --name sb3
  ```
